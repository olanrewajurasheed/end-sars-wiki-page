The slogan calls for the disbanding of theSpecial Anti-Robbery Squad(SARS), a notorious unit of theNigerian Policewith a long record of abuses.[2][3]The protests which takes its name from the slogan started in 2017 as aTwittercampaign using thehashtag#ENDSARS to demand the disbanding of the unit by theNigerian government.[4][5][6]After experiencing a revitalisation in October 2020 following more revelations of the abuses of the unit,mass demonstrationsoccurred throughout the major cities of Nigeria, accompanied by vociferous outrage on social media platforms. About 28 million tweets bearing the hashtag have been accumulated onTwitteralone.[7]Solidarity protests and demonstrations by Nigerians indiasporaand sympathizers occurred in many major cities of the world. The protests is notable for its patronage by a demographic that is made of entirely young Nigerians.[8][9]The movement has since expanded to include demands for good and acountable governance.Within a few days of renewed protests, on 11 October 2020, the Nigerian Police Force announced that it was dissolving the unit with immediate effect. The move was widely received as a triumph of the demonstrations.[10]However, it was noted in many quarters that similar announcements had been made in recent years to pacify the public without the unit actually being disbanded, and that the government had merely planned to reassign and review SARS officers to medical centres rather than disband the unit entirely.[11]Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian government has maintained a pattern of violent repression including the killing of demonstrators.[12]There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the movement has also grown increasingly critical ofMuhammadu Buhari'sgovernment response to the protests.[13]SARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, rape women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops andiPhones.[14]Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged inkidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture,unlawful arrests, humiliation,unlawful detention,extrajudicial killingsandextortionof Nigerian citizens. A large section of the victims of the abuses of SARS have been young male Nigerians.[15]Contents1Background2Initial protests and reaction3October 2020 second wave3.1Five demands3.2Nigerian Government response3.3Central bank freezes account of protesters4Timeline of events4.18 October4.29 October4.310 October4.411 October4.512 October4.613 October4.714 October4.815 October4.916 October4.1020 October - The Lekki Toll Gate Massacre4.1121 October4.1222 October5Nigerian protests by state5.1Delta State5.2Anambra State5.3Abia State5.4Osun State5.5Rivers State5.6Ogun State5.7Enugu State5.8Ebonyi State5.9Edo State5.10Plateau State5.10.120 October6Voluntary donations7International protests7.1Canada7.2Germany7.3Ireland7.3.1Dublin7.4United Kingdom7.4.1London7.4.2Manchester7.5United States7.5.1New York7.5.2Michigan7.6Social media8ReferencesBackgroundThe Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was a branch of theNigeria Police Forceunder theState Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department(SCIID). It was founded in late 1992 as one of the 14 units in the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, which was established to detain, investigate, and prosecute people involved in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes.[16]The squad was created as a masked police unit tto perform undercover operations against violent crimes likearmed robbery, car snatching,kidnapping,cattle rustling, and the bearing and use of illegal firearms.[17]SARS had been accused of several human rights violations, illegal \"stop and searches\", illegal arrests and detentions, extrajudicial killings, sexual harassment of women and brutalising of young male Nigerians. The human rights abuses were documented in trending videos on social media.[18]In 2017, Nigerian activists, youth and celebrities across the nation took to the streets in a peaceful protest to spread awareness of SARS brutality and extortions and to demand its disbanding. The protests also moved to social media using the hashtag #EndSARS.[19][20][21]A 2016 report byAmnesty International, indicted SARS maintaining that the squad was responsible for human rights abuses, cruelty, degrading treatment of Nigerians in their custody, and other widespread torture. Some of the human rights abuses by SARS include the shooting of their detainees in the leg, mock executions and threats of execution, hanging and physical assault.[22]A 2020 publication by the organisation documented 82 cases of abuses and extra judicial killings by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020.[23]Initial protests and reactionAmnesty Internationalaccused the SARS officials of regularly detaining young maleNigeriansillegally and extorting money from their relatives.[4]In 2016, a human rights activist, Segun Awosanya popularly known asSegalinkstarted EndSARS campaign on social media prompting police authority to announce reform of the police unit but nothing was achieved at the time.[24]In 2018, Nigerian rapper Michael Ugochukwu Stephens professionally known Ruggedman joined the campaign to end police brutality by releasing a single titled,Is Police Your Friend?[25]In 2017, a petition signed by 10,195 people was submitted toNigeria's National Assemblycalling for a total disbandment of SARS.[26]A fewSenatorsbacked the call for total disbandment of the unit.[27]Consideration was given to reforming the force, rather than full disbandment due to the number of cases falling.[28][29]The campaigners moved fromsocial mediausing the #EndSARS hashtag to organised, peaceful protests inAbuja,Lagos,Ibadan,Osun,Benin,Ughelli,Warri,Ilorin,Ogbomosho,Owerri,Jos,Kaduna,Calabar[30][20]and other Nigerian cities and states, threatening to continue if the government refused to disband the force.[31][32][33]In response to the campaign, Nigeria Police Force Public Relations OfficerJimoh Moshoodaccused the campaigners of being \"criminals\".[34]Despite this,Inspector Generalof Nigeria Police ForceIbrahim K. Idrisordered the reform and reorganisation of SARS.[35]October 2020 second waveOn Saturday 3 October 2020, a video showing a SARS police officer shooting a young Nigerian in front of Wetland Hotel,Ughelli,Delta Statetrended on the Internet. It was alleged that the police officers took away the young man's vehicle – aLexusSUV.[36]The trending video caused public outcry on social media, especially on Twitter, with the #ENDSARS hashtag trending.[37]Just as the ENDSARS trend began on Twitter, on Monday 5 October 2020, another report surfaced of SARS officers killing a 20-year-old upcoming musician named Daniel Chibuike, popularly called Sleek in his neighbourhood.[38]Sleek was said to be sitting in front of a hotel with a friend when the SARS officers approached them, prompting them to flee. According to an eyewitness, the SARS men pursued the pair, shouting \"thief\", before shooting Sleek as they ran through a supermarket.[38]His friend was arrested.On Thursday 8 October 2020, nationwide protests on ENDSARS started after weeks of outrage and anger with videos and pictures showing police brutality, harassment and extortion in Nigeria. The protests were led predominantly by young Nigerians in different cities alongside many activists and celebrities.[39]Nigeria Police Forcedisrupted the protests in some cities, throwing teargas, using water cannons and shooting at unarmed peaceful protesters as seen inAbujaandOsun.[40]This led to the death of Jimoh Isiaq in Ogbomoso,OyoState.[41][14][42][43][44]By Wednesday, 14 October 2020, the End SARS protests were still on-going with young people in different parts of Nigeria intensifying their calls for reforms and accountability in police operations.[45]Five demandsOn Sunday, 11 October 2020, the protestors made a list of five demands to be met by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The demands which were signed by 'A Nigerian Youth' demanded for the immediate release of all arrested during the protests as well as justice and compensation for all who died through police brutality in Nigeria. They also demanded that an independent body be set up within 10 days to investigate and prosecute all reports of police misconduct. The protestors also asked for the psychological evaluation and retraining of SARS operatives before they are deployed to any other police unit. Lastly, they asked for adequate increase in the salaries for officers of the Nigerian police.[46]Nigerian Government responseIn response to the public outcry on police brutality, the Inspector-General of Nigeria Police banned the FSARS, Special Tactical Squad (STS), Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Anti-Cultism Squad and other tactical units from mounting of roadblocks, checkpoints, stop-and-search and other routine and patrols. Similar bans had been announced multiple times over the previous four years, causing citizens of Nigeria to question whether the bans would actually be upheld. There were further reports of SARS officers involved in killings across the country.[47]As this was the fourth time that the Nigerian government had announced a similar ban on SARS activity,[48]protesters insisted that the notorious police unit be entirely disbanded and wide-ranging reform of the force to follow.[49]Central bank freezes account of protestersOn Tuesday, 20 October 2020, theCentral Bank of Nigeriaand its Governor,Godwin Emefieleobtained an exparte motion to freeze the accounts of notable participants in the End SARS protest. In an exclusive report byPeoples Gazette, court documents showed that theCentral Bank of Nigeriafailed to give any justification for the freezing order. Twenty protesters with banking withAccess Bank plc,Fidelity Bank Nigeria,First Bank of Nigeria,Guaranty Trust Bank,United Bank for AfricaandZenith Bankhad all accounts linked to them placed under \"post no debit\".[50][51]Timeline of events8 OctoberLagos State governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, addressing protesters gathered at Alausa, LagosNigerian youths protested on EndSARS at theLagos State Governor's Houseon Thursday 8 October and slept at the gate of the government house till Friday 9 October 2020 when the Deputy Governor addressed the protesters.[52]Among the Lagos State EndSARS Protesters were celebritiesFalz,Runtown,Don Jazzy,Olu Jacobs,Eedris Abdulkareemand a host of others including several comedians and other media personalities.[53]9 OctoberResting protesters in Lagos, NigeriaOn Friday, 9 October 2020, the Deputy Governor of Lagos State,Femi Hamzataddressed the protesters and acknowledged that police officers do not have the right to trample on the rights of law-abiding citizens based on their appearance or on items in their possession.

The parliamentarians made a seven-point resolution, as follows: Nigeria's Senate and House of Assembly should probe FSARS, the Police Commissioner should protect protesters, molestation of youths should be stopped, institution of public inquiry on the extrajudicial killings by Senate President and the House of Representatives Speaker, proscription of SARS and its replacement by a new unit with a clear code of conduct, and sanction of illegalities.[58]Nigerian youths protested on EndSARS,[59]at the headquarters ofNigeria Police Forcein Federal Capital Territory,Abujaand vow to camp at headquarters till Inspector-General of Police,Mohammed Adamu, addresses them.[60]10 OctoberWhile the protest continued on Saturday 10 October 2020, the Nigerian police started dispersing the youths with tear gas and water.

In response to the death of the protesters, the commissioner of police of Oyo State, Nwachukwu Enwonwu, denied the allegation that the police killed the protester. He said that the police used tear gas to prevent protesters from attacking and entering the police station.

Many Nigerians within the movement criticised the announcement, however, pointing out that similar promises had been made in earlier years and that the government's plan was to reassign SARS officers to other police departments rather than eliminate them from the force entirely.[11]The protests continue despite the \"dissolution\" as many do not believe the pronouncement.[64]David Adeleke, a popular musician known asDavidojoined a group of #EndSARS protesters in Abuja to call for the end police brutality and the notorious police unit in the city. The police started dispersing the protesters with tear gas, live bullets and water cannons.[65]Three more protestors were shot dead in Ogbomoso, Oyo State, following a killing the day before.[66]12 OctoberOn Monday, 12 October 2020, the Governor of Lagos StateBabajide Sanwo-Oluand the Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, urged protestors to believe that SARS has been disbanded.[67]On Monday, 12 October 2020 theRivers StateGovernor,Nyesom Wikeannounced that the End SARS protests are disallowed in Rivers State.

The Governor also announced the constitution of a five-member Police Complaints Committee with two representatives from youth organisations.[75]The Governor had earlier appealed to the police to desist from harassing the protesters as people were free to express grievances in a democratic dispensation.[76]On Tuesday, 13 October 2020, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian Police Force, Frank Mba, announced the setting up of a Special Weapon and Tactics Team (SWAT) to replace SARS. The new outfit, which is expected to take off within the next 7 days, will undergo psychological and medical evaluation to determine their fitness.[59]The protest was taken to the National Assembly. Moving from Banex junction Abuja, protesters peacefully marched to the junction leading to the National Assembly around 2 p.m. where they were stopped by soldiers who violently resisted their movement and injured some protesters in the process.[77]ARISE TV news crew who were recording the fracas at the entry of the National Assembly were attacked.

The decision was taken at a meeting which held on Wednesday, 14 October 2020 and which was chaired by FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello. The announcement recognised the rights of citizens to gather and demonstrate however, it went on to point out that the EndSARS protests were unruly, caused discomfort to people, violatedCOVID-19protocols and should be discontinued in view of the fact that Government had met the demands of the protesters.[88]Nigerians thought this absurd since there had been elections in Ondo and Edo along with massive rallies in preceding weeks.[89]Buhari's daughter had also had her wedding ceremony.[90]At the peak of the pandemic,Abba Kyari, late Chief of Staff to the President of Nigeria, was buried without adherence to COVID-19 guidelines.[91]People conveyed by Lagos state buses attacked protesters near the state secretariat in Alausa.[92]16 OctoberOn Friday, 16 October 2020, the hacktivist group,Anonymoushacked the Twitter account of theNational Broadcasting Commissionand posted a message which stated \"We #Anonymous will continue supporting Nigerians\" in a support for the ongoing protests.[93]Thousands of protesters gathered at the Lekki toll gate and Alausa, Ikeja to hold a candlelight session for the various victims of SARS/police killings.[94][95]A day after the FCTA banned protests across the Capital territory amidst fear of a second wave of theCOVID-19outbreak due to the protests,[96]youths protesting against Police brutality and abuses moved their protest from City gate to airport road where they obstructed both incoming and outgoing commuters thereby causing a gridlock leaving thousands stranded.[97]20 October - The Lekki Toll Gate MassacreFurther information:Lekki massacreFollowing violent escalations which included attacks by agitators against both protesters and police, the governor of Lagos state,Babajide Sanwo-Olu, declared a state-wide 24-hour curfew[98]effective 4:00 PM WAT on 20 October. During this time, images of some persons alleged to be working with the Lagos State government and the Lekki Concession Company removing cameras (later confirmed by the Lagos State Government to be laser cameras and not CCTV cameras as earlier publicized on social media[99]) at the toll gate circulated onEnd SARSonTwitterand street lights at the toll gate vicinity were turned off. A few hours later, it was reported that armed men of the Nigerian Army arrived at the scene of the protest andopened fire on peaceful and unarmed protesters, thereby resulting in a disputed number of deaths. A clip of the shooting trending on the Internet. There were also reports that at least 50 other people were injured. However, the Lagos State government later reported that the shooting resulted in up to 25 injured, and only 2 dead.[100]Despite the fact that the curfew was extended till 9:00 PM, soldiers of the Nigerian Army started shooting before 7:00 PM.[101][102][103][104][105][106]21 OctoberFollowing the killings on 20 October, video evidence showed that more shootings were still being carried out by the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police on the unarmed protesters. Some people also attacked and burnt buildings, vehicles, TV stations and raided the Oba of Lagos' palace.[107]The governor of Lagos had said that there were no casualties from the incident of the previous day but later tweeted that there had been reports of one casualty which negated the report sent in by various Twitter and Instagram users who had live recordings of the killings. While the protesters gathered again at the Lekki toll gate where the shooting took place on Tuesday 20 October, they were forced out by police.[107]While the protesters defied the curfew imposed by the Lagos state Governor, hoodlums burnt about 30 government buses at a bus station. Also burnt was Television Continental Station (TVC) linked to a former governor of the state,Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is a national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).[108][109]About seven people were reportedly killed within 24 hours since soldiers opened fire at protesters in Lagos. Authorities did not deny carrying out a crackdown, but refused to claim the deaths as of 21 October 2020. Brutality by the police forces made the protesters more angry intensifying the scale of the protests.[110]22 OctoberOn Thursday, October 22, it was reported[111]that armed men began shooting at protesters inOyigbo,Port Harcourt.[112][113]The attackers began breaking into homes, murdering those inside, and afterwards, torching down properties.
